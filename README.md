# ees README

This extension provides syntax highlighting for the Sintelix EES (Entity Extraction Script) language. 

## Features

Syntax highlighting for:
- EES variables ($...)
- annotations (e.g. tag:Person)
- EES statements/directives (e.g. #cond)
- aliases (e.g. @ALIASNAME)
- style overrides for double-quoted strings
- colours are consistent with those in Sintelix while using the DarkReader Chrome extension, and very similar to those in standard light-mode

## Requirements

This extension comes with a custom theme, EES Theme, which is a variation on VS Code's Dark+ theme. You must use this theme for EES syntax highlighting to work.
